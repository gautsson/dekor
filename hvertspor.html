                    <h3>Analysis by Nanna Katrín Hannesdóttir</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Hvert örstutt spor is from a little bit different context than our previous poems. It is from a
                        play, Silfurtúnglið, which premiered in 1954 (about 15-20 years later than Heimsljós). In the
                        later years of his career Laxness expiremented with writing plays along with novels, none of
                        which were as great of a success as the earlier pieces though.
                        <br><br>Jón Nordal, our songs composer,
                        made a song to Hvert örstutt spor specially for the premiere of the play and that same song has
                        lived on ever since. Hvert örstutt spor is thus not a poem turned into a song later but a song
                        from the very start. What is more it is very central in the play and appears multiple times, it
                        sort of binds the storyline together.
                        <br><br>
                        I will not go into great depths with the story this time- because then I would definitely spoil
                        too much. But in short the story is about a young mother Lóa, who lives in the countryside in
                        Iceland. The play begins with a scene in Lóa’s home where she is singing Hvert örstutt spor to
                        her little baby boy as a lullaby. An old friend of Lóa’s who is now a world famous singer has
                        just arrived in town for a visit and accidentally overhears the singing. The friend is
                        mesmerized by the beauty and purity of the lyrics and song and l contacts a friend of hers, the
                        shady agent/manager Feilan O Feilan, who owns a theatre in Reykjavík called Silfurtúnglið. Long
                        story short this Feilan becomes very interested in making an act out of Lóa singing Hvert
                        örstutt spor to be performed in Silfurtúnglið. Lóa is hesitant but curious and more than a
                        little flattered and eventually decides to leave her small town and her baby boy and heads to
                        the capital….
                        <br><br>
                        If you just look at the song, Hvert örstutt spor itself it’s easy to understand why the
                        characters of Silfurtúnglið were so captivated by it. The lyrics are beautiful. It is a poem
                        full of gratitude and humility; a declaration of a mother’s love to her little baby. In the
                        first and second verse she describes how happy she is, now that he is in her life, and how empty
                        the joy she felt before is in comparison with her love towards him. She describes the wonder of
                        just getting to hearing his voice. -There is a lot of wonder in this poem which gives it so much
                        extra depth. She is always asking; how can something as wonderful as my baby boy exist? It is
                        like she gets a new perspective on life- In the third verse she points out how innocent someone
                        who has not seen the cruelty of the world is in a quite unforgettable way. The fourth and last
                        verse is then just pure gratitude. Pure god -or the bigger picture, or the cosmos or whatever
                        (if you don’t find the thought of god beautiful). She is grateful to get to experience these
                        precious moments, but points out dramatically in the end that they are fleeting.

                        A fun fact to end with (coming from my grandmother). In 1955, following the premier of the play
                        a club called Silfurtunglið was opened on the second floor of Austurbæjarbíó (where the árshátíð
                        was). This club was open about 20 years. And what is more, the company that is renting out
                        Austurbær now calls one of it’s rooms Silfurtunglið. It’s probably the same one as where the
                        club was; on the second floor. So not the one we sung in, but almost!
